# Neo-Robotics-Code

This is the official code repository for Neo robotics. All of this code is going to be written by either Liam Ramirez-Guess of Jacob. Please ask before copying the code or 
modifing it without downloading it(so editing the code IN the repository is a no no). This Repository is for the code itself, for the complete Neo Robotics repository please 
go to : https://github.com/LRGuess/Neo-Robotics 

Thanks!!
